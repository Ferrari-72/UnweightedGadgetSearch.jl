## Part A: Conceptual Questions 概念性问题

### Q1: Why is unweighted MIS reduction harder than weighted? 为什么无权MIS归约比加权更难？

**Answer 回答**:

In **weighted** reduction (Nguyen et al., 2023):
- You can use vertex weights as "knobs" (旋钮) to fine-tune behavior
- A vertex with weight 0.5 contributes "half" to the objective
- More flexibility in designing gadgets

In **unweighted** reduction:
- Every vertex has weight 1 — no fine-tuning possible
- Gadgets must work with integer MIS sizes only
- Much harder to achieve exact α-tensor equivalence

**Analogy 类比**: 
- Weighted is like adjusting a dimmer switch (可调光开关)
- Unweighted is like on/off switches only (开关只有开/关)

### Q2: What exactly does "reduction" mean here? 这里的"归约"具体指什么？

**Answer 回答**:

**Reduction** (归约) transforms one problem into another such that:

1. **Forward mapping**: Any instance of Problem A → instance of Problem B
   - Graph G → King's subgraph G'
   
2. **Solution correspondence**: Solution of B → Solution of A
   - MIS of G' → MIS of G
   
3. **Efficiency**: The transformation is polynomial time
   - Here: O(|V| × pw(G))

**NOT a simulation!** We're not running G on G', we're transforming the problem itself.

### Q3: Why King's graph specifically? 为什么特别选择国王图？

**Answer 回答**:

King's graph = Square grid + diagonal connections

**Reasons**:
1. **Unit disk property**: Vertices at distance ≤ √2 are connected
2. **Hardware friendly**: Square grids are easy to manufacture
3. **Universal enough**: Any graph can be embedded (with overhead)
4. **Rydberg atoms**: Natural implementation on neutral-atom computers

**Alternative targets**:
- Pure square grid (4-connected) — likely needs larger gadgets
- Triangular lattice (6-connected) — your future research!
- Honeycomb lattice (3-connected) — probably not universal

### Q4: What is pathwidth intuitively? 路径宽度直观上是什么？

**Answer 回答**:

**Intuition 1 (Graph layout)** 图布局:
Imagine laying out vertices left-to-right. Pathwidth = maximum number of "open" edges at any point.

**Intuition 2 (Game)** 游戏:
A searcher catches a robber on the graph. Pathwidth = minimum searchers needed if robber is slow.

**Intuition 3 (Tree-likeness)** 树状程度:
- Pathwidth 1 → graph is a path (路径图)
- Small pathwidth → graph is "linear" (线性的)
- Large pathwidth → graph has complex structure

**Examples**:
| Graph | Pathwidth |
|-------|-----------|
| Path (n vertices) | 1 |
| Cycle | 2 |
| Binary tree | O(log n) |
| Complete graph K_n | n-1 |
| n×n Grid | n |

### Q5: What's the α-tensor in simple terms? 用简单的话说什么是α张量？

**Answer 回答**:

The **α-tensor** is like a lookup table:

"Given the boundary is configured as X, what's the best I can do inside?"

**Example** (simple path gadget):
```
Boundary: ●───○───●
          1       2

If 1=OFF, 2=OFF: can select ○ → α[0,0] = 1
If 1=ON,  2=OFF: cannot select ○ (blocked) → α[1,0] = 0  
If 1=OFF, 2=ON:  cannot select ○ → α[0,1] = 0
If 1=ON,  2=ON:  ○ double-blocked → α[1,1] = 0
```

The **reduced** α-tensor subtracts boundary contributions:
```
α̃[i,j] = α[i,j] - i - j
```

This isolates the gadget's "internal" contribution.

### Q6: Why is the BATOIDEA gadget named that way? 为什么叫BATOIDEA？

**Answer 回答**:

BATOIDEA (蝠鲼科) refers to the **ray fish family** (魔鬼鱼家族).

Looking at the gadget shape:
```
  ⋅ ● ⋅ ⋅ ⋅
  ● ● ● ● ●     ← Looks like a ray swimming
  ⋅ ● ● ● ⋅
  ⋅ ⋅ ● ⋅ ⋅
```

The paper authors chose evocative names for gadgets found by computer search!

## Part B: Technical Questions 技术性问题

### Q7: How does the solution mapping back work? 解如何映射回原图？

**Answer 回答**:

**Step-by-step process**:

1. **Start** with MIS configuration on mapped graph (grid)

2. **Reverse** each gadget application (in reverse order!):
   - Find gadget position in grid
   - Read boundary configuration from current solution
   - Look up in `mapped_entry_to_compact`: boundary → compact form
   - Look up in `source_entry_to_configs`: compact → original configs
   - Choose one valid internal configuration
   - Write back to grid

3. **Read** copy line values:
   - Each copy line represents one original vertex
   - The value is consistent along the line (by construction)
   - Extract the original vertex configuration

**Code path**:
```
map_config_back()
  → _map_configs_back()
    → unapply_gadgets!()
      → map_config_back!() for each gadget
    → map_config_copyback!()
```

### Q8: What if multiple valid configurations exist? 如果存在多个有效配置怎么办？

**Answer 回答**:

This is handled by `source_entry_to_configs` returning a **list** of valid configurations:

```julia
# Example from extracting_results.jl
source_entry_to_configs(::Turn) = Dict(
    0 => [[0,1,0,1,0]],        # Only one option
    1 => [[1,0,1,0,0], [1,0,0,1,0]],  # TWO valid options!
    ...
)
```

The code picks **randomly** among valid options:
```julia
newconfig = rand(_map_config_back(p, config))  # Random choice
```

**Important**: All valid configurations give the **same MIS size** (by α-tensor equivalence), so the choice doesn't matter for correctness.

### Q9: How was the computer search implemented? 计算机搜索是如何实现的？

**Answer 回答**:

**Key optimizations** (from Appendix C):

1. **Non-isomorphic enumeration**: Use McKay's nauty to generate only non-isomorphic graphs
   - 11 vertices: only ~1 billion graphs instead of 2^55

2. **Symmetry filtering**: The CROSS pattern is symmetric under:
   - 1↔3 (top-bottom swap)
   - 2↔4 (left-right swap)  
   - (1,3)↔(2,4) (horizontal-vertical swap)
   - Reduces boundary choices by factor ~8

3. **Crossing criteria**: Quick geometric test
   - All paths from 1→3 must cross all paths from 2→4
   - Eliminates most candidates without computing α-tensor

4. **Parallel execution**: Run on multi-core machine
   - Paper used 72-core AWS EC2 instance
   - Completed in less than one day

### Q10: What's the relationship between pathwidth and treewidth? 路径宽度和树宽的关系是什么？

**Answer 回答**:

**Treewidth** (树宽, tw): How well a graph can be decomposed into a tree structure

**Pathwidth** (路径宽度, pw): How well a graph can be decomposed into a path structure

**Relationship**:
```
tw(G) ≤ pw(G) ≤ tw(G) × O(log n)
```

- Pathwidth is always ≥ treewidth (路径是特殊的树)
- For many graphs: pw ≈ tw (差不多)
- Worst case: pw can be O(log n) times larger

**Why use pathwidth here?**
- The copy line construction is inherently "linear" (path-like)
- Path decomposition maps naturally to grid layout
- Treewidth would require more complex 2D structures

## Part C: Research Questions 研究问题

### Q11: Is the O(|V| × pw(G)) bound tight? 这个复杂度界限是紧的吗？

**Answer 回答**:

**Yes!** (Assuming ETH — Exponential Time Hypothesis)

**Proof idea**:
1. General MIS requires 2^Ω(n) time (under ETH)
2. King's graph MIS can be solved in 2^O(pw) time
3. If reduction gave |V'| = o(|V| × pw), we could solve general MIS in 2^o(n) time
4. Contradiction with ETH!

**Implication**: Any polynomial reduction must have at least this overhead.

### Q12: Can we do better for special graph classes? 对特殊图类能做得更好吗？

**Answer 回答**:

**Yes!** For graphs with structure:

| Graph Class | Possible Improvement |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Planar graphs | May have smaller gadgets |
| Bounded-degree graphs | Linear vertex overhead possible |
| Sparse graphs | Fewer crossings → less overhead |
| Trees | Trivial embedding (no crossings!) |

**Research opportunity**: Specialized reductions for structured graphs.

### Q13: How does this relate to quantum advantage? 这与量子优势有什么关系？

**Answer 回答**:

**The connection**:
1. Neutral-atom quantum computers naturally implement MIS on unit disk graphs
2. Quantum algorithms might find MIS faster than classical (量子可能更快)
3. This reduction lets us use quantum hardware for **any** graph's MIS

**BUT**:
- The reduction itself is **classical** (经典计算)
- Overhead might eat into quantum advantage
- Practical speedup depends on problem size and hardware quality

**Open question**: For what problems does quantum MIS actually give speedup after reduction overhead?

### Q14: What are the main open problems? 主要的开放问题有哪些？

**Answer 回答**:

4. **Approximate MIS**: Does reduction preserve approximation ratios?

5. **Weighted-unweighted connection**: When is weighted reduction actually better?

6. **Implementation on real hardware**: Gap between theory and practice?

## If Your Advisor Asks... 如果导师问你...

**"Explain the main contribution in one sentence"**
"We show how to reduce unweighted MIS on any graph to unweighted MIS on a King's subgraph with at most O(|V|×pw(G)) vertices, which is optimal under ETH."

**"What's novel compared to the weighted version?"**
"The unweighted case requires fundamentally different gadgets because we can't use fractional weights to fine-tune the reduction, requiring computer-assisted search to find valid crossing gadgets."

**"Why should we care?"**
"Neutral-atom quantum computers can only solve unit disk graph MIS directly; this reduction makes them applicable to general graph problems while being hardware-friendly (no need for individual atom control)."

**"What's the next step?"**
"Extending this framework to triangular lattices, which may have different optimal gadgets and could be relevant for different quantum hardware architectures."
