## 1. Why Triangular Lattice? 为什么研究三角晶格？

### Current Paper: King's Graph (Square Grid) 当前论文：国王图（方格）

```
King's Graph connectivity:
● ● ●
● K ●    Each vertex connects to 8 neighbors
● ● ●    (4 orthogonal + 4 diagonal)
```

### Triangular Lattice 三角晶格

```
Triangular Lattice connectivity:
    ●   ●   ●
   / \ / \ / \
  ●   ●   ●   ●     Each vertex connects to 6 neighbors
   \ / \ / \ /
    ●   ●   ●
```

### Motivation 动机

1. **Different hardware**: Some quantum systems naturally form triangular arrangements
2. **Different connectivity**: 6-neighbor vs 8-neighbor changes gadget design
3. **Potentially tighter packing**: Triangular grids can be more efficient for some problems
4. **Theoretical interest**: Understanding what graph structures support efficient reduction

## 2. Key Challenges for Triangular Lattice 三角晶格的关键挑战

### Challenge 1: Different Crossing Geometry 不同的交叉几何

In King's graph:
```
Paths can cross at 90° angles
      |
   ---+---
      |
```

In triangular lattice:
```
Paths must cross at 60° or 120° angles
      /
   --+
      \
```

**This means**: The BATOIDEA gadget (designed for square grid) won't work!

### Challenge 2: New Gadget Search Space 新的组件搜索空间

For King's graph, the paper searched graphs up to 11 vertices and found 4 valid crossing gadgets.

For triangular lattice:
- Different unit disk geometry
- Different neighbor structure
- Need to re-run exhaustive search

### Challenge 3: Copy Line Structure 复制线结构

The T-shaped copy lines rely on:
- Horizontal lines (0° direction)
- Vertical lines (90° direction)
- 45° diagonal connections

For triangular:
- Need to work with 60° angles
- Copy lines might be "bent" differently

## 3. Research Plan 研究计划

### Phase 1: Understand the Unit Disk Constraint 理解单位圆盘约束

**Question**: What is the unit disk graph on a triangular lattice?

**Task**:
1. Define triangular lattice coordinates
2. Determine which vertices are within unit distance
3. Visualize the connectivity pattern

```julia
# Proposed code for triangular unit disk graph
function triangular_unit_disk_graph(locs::AbstractVector{Tuple{Float64,Float64}}, radius::Real)
    # Similar to unit_disk_graph, but locs are on triangular lattice
    g = SimpleGraph(length(locs))
    for i = 1:length(locs)
        for j = i+1:length(locs)
            if euclidean_distance(locs[i], locs[j]) <= radius
                add_edge!(g, i, j)
            end
        end
    end
    return g
end

# Triangular lattice coordinates:
# Row 0: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), ...
# Row 1: (0.5, √3/2), (1.5, √3/2), ...
# Row 2: (0, √3), (1, √3), ...
```

### Phase 2: Find Crossing Gadgets 寻找交叉组件

**Method**: Adapt Algorithm C.1 from the paper

```
For each graph size n (start small, n=5,6,7,...):
    For each non-isomorphic graph G of size n:
        For each choice of 4 boundary vertices:
            R' = (G, boundary)
            
            If has_triangular_embedding(R'):  # NEW: triangular instead of square
                Compute α̃(R')
                If α̃(R') differs from α̃(CROSS) by constant:
                    FOUND! Record R'
```

**Key function to implement**:
```julia
function has_triangular_embedding(graph, boundary_vertices)
    # Variational optimization with triangular lattice constraint
    # Similar to has_unit_disk_embedding but on triangular grid
end
```

### Phase 3: Design Copy Lines 设计复制线

**Questions to answer**:
1. What is the triangular analogue of the T-shaped copy line?
2. How do branches work on 60° angles?
3. What's the spacing between copy lines?

**Possible approach**: "Y-shaped" or "Mercedes" copy lines
```
    /
   /
  ●
   \
    \
```

### Phase 4: Implement Full Pipeline 实现完整流程

1. New `TriangularMappingGrid` type
2. Triangular copy line generation
3. New gadget ruleset for triangular
4. Back-mapping functions

---

## 4. Code Modification Strategy 代码修改策略

### Option A: Extend Existing Code 扩展现有代码

```julia
# Add to src/Core.jl
abstract type LatticeType end
struct SquareLattice <: LatticeType end
struct TriangularLattice <: LatticeType end

# Parameterize functions by lattice type
function unitdisk_graph(locs, radius, ::SquareLattice)
    # Current implementation
end

function unitdisk_graph(locs, radius, ::TriangularLattice)
    # New triangular implementation
end
```

### Option B: Create Parallel Module 创建并行模块

```
src/
├── UnitDiskMapping.jl          (keep as is)
├── triangular/
│   ├── TriangularMapping.jl    (new main module)
│   ├── triangular_core.jl      (triangular types)
│   ├── triangular_gadgets.jl   (new gadgets)
│   └── triangular_mapping.jl   (mapping algorithm)
```

### Recommended Approach 推荐方法

**Start with Option B** (parallel module):
- Doesn't break existing code
- Easier to experiment
- Can later refactor to Option A if patterns emerge

## 5. Specific Tasks for You 具体任务

### Task 1: Study Unit Disk Geometry 研究单位圆盘几何

```julia
# Experiment: Visualize triangular lattice unit disk connections
using Plots

function triangular_lattice(rows, cols)
    locs = Tuple{Float64, Float64}[]
    for r in 0:rows-1
        for c in 0:cols-1
            x = c + (r % 2) * 0.5
            y = r * sqrt(3)/2
            push!(locs, (x, y))
        end
    end
    return locs
end

# Plot and check connectivity
locs = triangular_lattice(5, 5)
# What radius gives 6-connectivity?
```

### Task 2: Understand CROSS Pattern 理解CROSS模式

Study why CROSS (the pattern) has these specific properties:
- 4 boundary vertices
- Paths must cross geometrically
- Why is the α-tensor symmetric under 1↔3, 2↔4?

**Read carefully**: Appendix C.1 (Crossing Criteria)

### Task 3: Small Gadget Enumeration 小组件枚举

Start with small graphs (n=5,6,7) and manually check:
1. Can they embed on triangular lattice?
2. Do they satisfy crossing criteria?
3. What's their α-tensor?

### Task 4: Implement Basic Infrastructure 实现基础设施

```julia
# File: src/triangular/triangular_core.jl

struct TriangularNode
    q::Int  # "row" in triangular coords
    r::Int  # "column" in triangular coords
end

# Convert to Cartesian
function to_cartesian(n::TriangularNode)
    x = n.r + n.q * 0.5
    y = n.q * sqrt(3)/2
    return (x, y)
end

# Distance function
function distance(n1::TriangularNode, n2::TriangularNode)
    p1, p2 = to_cartesian(n1), to_cartesian(n2)
    return sqrt((p1[1]-p2[1])^2 + (p1[2]-p2[2])^2)
end
```
